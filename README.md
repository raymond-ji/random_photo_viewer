# What is this?

This application lets you specify a folder where your photos reside, choose a number of photos to go through and how long to display each photo. It will then randomly select a photo each time and show it. 

Inspired by a post on practicing timed gesture drawing sessions

# Usage

macOS only: download RandomPhotoViewer.dmg and run the application inside.

Note: currently if you want to stop the photos early, open up "Activity Monitor", search for RandomPhotoViewer and close it.
