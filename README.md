# What is this?

This application lets you specify a folder where your photos reside, choose a number of photos to go through and how long to display each photo. It will then randomly select a photo each time and show it. 

Inspired by a post on practicing timed gesture drawing sessions

# Usage

macOS only: download RandomPhotoViewer.dmg and run the application inside.

You'll likely get a security warning, to get around that and run the app, follow the link below.
IMPORTANT: generally speaking you do NOT want to do this with random files you find off the internet, that's an easy way to get hacked. Please exercise caution and decide if you trust the developer.

Note: if you want to stop the photos early, open up "Activity Monitor", search for RandomPhotoViewer and close it.
