# What is this?

This script lets you specify a folder where your photos reside, choose a number of photos to go through and how long to display each photo. It will then randomly select a photo each time and show it. 

Inspired by a post on practicing timed gesture drawing sessions

# Usage

- download `randomly_show_photos.sh`
- open terminal
- give it executable permissions: `chmod u+x /path/to/randomly_show_photos.sh`
- run it with: `/path/to/randomly_show_photos.sh /path/to/photos/dir <numPhotosToShow> <minutesPerPhoto>`

Note: if you want to stop the photos early, open up "Activity Monitor", search for RandomPhotoViewer and close it.
